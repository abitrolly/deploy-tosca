Code adopted from https://github.com/xlab-si/xopera-examples

1. Run `./01install.sh` to install xOpera and Ansible
2. Run `bash 02deploy.sh` to deploy hello app to localhost
3. Open http://locahost to see "hello web"

NOTE: Apache2 installed on deploy, will not be uninstalled
on undeploy and original page is not restored in that case.
